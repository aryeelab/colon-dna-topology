This repository contains code behind the analyses of high-throughput sequencing data of the paper titled "Large-Scale Topological Changes Restrain Malignant Progression in Colorectal Cancer". The code is organized as an R package in which the `R` directory contains supporting functions and the `vignettes` directory contain the code that reproduces the figures.
